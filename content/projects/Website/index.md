## **Project Scope**

The **Scrambled Egg Rice** website mock-up replicates a seamless online food ordering experience. It features user-friendly navigation, detailed product menus, ordering forms, and registration options. The project emphasises responsive design and clean visuals to deliver an enjoyable browsing experience. This is an individual project, where I coded the HTML and CSS from scratch as a mock-up for a fictitious food store in my school.

---

## **My Role**

As the sole contributor to this project, I conceptualised, designed, and implemented the entire website. I created the HTML and CSS from scratch, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing layout. Additionally, I integrated external tools for form handling and incorporated custom images and typography to enhance the overall user experience.

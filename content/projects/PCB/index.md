<!-- ## Overview
This project highlights the design and implementation of a **4-layer printed circuit board (PCB)** using **Autodesk Eagle** software. The PCB features carefully routed traces, components, and a clean schematic layout, showcasing both the functional design and aesthetic organization of a complex electronics project.

## Key Features
- **4-Layer Board:** Ensures efficient signal routing, improved noise management, and compact design.
- **Autodesk Eagle:** Industry-standard software used for both schematic design and PCB layout.
- **Component Integration:** Incorporates LEDs, ICs, capacitors, resistors, and other components for system functionality.
- **Custom Traces:** Meticulously routed connections to optimize signal flow and performance.
- **Functional Layout:** Combines power delivery, signal transmission, and programmable headers for flexibility.

## Tools and Software
- **Autodesk Eagle**: Used for schematic capture and PCB layout.
- **Soldering and Assembly Tools**: For populating and testing the physical board.

## The Design Process
1. **Schematic Design**: The logical connections between components were drawn and verified.
2. **Component Placement**: Components were positioned for minimal trace lengths and optimal performance.
3. **Layer Routing**: 
   - Top and bottom layers for signal traces.
   - Inner layers for power and ground planes.
4. **DRC (Design Rule Check)**: Ensured no errors in trace widths, clearances, and placements.

## Board Highlights
The image below displays the completed PCB layout:
- **Multiple Components**: Including ICs, voltage regulators, and a 7-segment display.
- **Headers**: Programming and input/output headers for external connections.
- **Power Distribution**: Separate planes for VCC and GND to reduce noise.
- **Silkscreen**: Annotated with component labels for easier debugging and assembly.
